    <p>Very simple demo of cookie interception using the library.  See page source to see how easy it is to hijack cookie creation and accessing functionality and replace/augment it with your own logic.</p>
    
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cookiejacker is init()ed on body onload, which causes shims to be put in place that hijack the browser's default cookie getter and setter</li>
        <li>These shims provide their own default custom getter/setter which just call the browser's native getter and setter, to replicate the default behaviour until explicitly overridden with your custom code</li>
        <li>We override these custom shims with our own special custom getter and setter, which log the cookie to the div below and then manually call the browser's native getter/setter to show how it's done.</li>
        <li>We can then assign and read cookies as normal (<em>document.cookie="var=val"</em>, and <em>var x=document.cookie</em> respectively), except that the contents of the cookie is also intercepted and logged below.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This gives us the ability to intercept cookies whenever they're set or read, even from dynamically-loaded third-party code, and prevent or modify their creation or retrieval at our own discretion.</p>
